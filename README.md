Training AI to play Snake || Genetic Algorithm + Neural Network 

snake.py: Plays a game of snake with the instructions from the neural network, given any array of 24 weights 
neuralnet.py: processes a desicion of weather to move up, right, or left given the current state of the snake and an array of 24 chromosomes 
main.py: main engine of the game, contains fitness and mating functions

currently you can only see massive results after a few hundred generations so i'm in the process of reviseing the nueral network
